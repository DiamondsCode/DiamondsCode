## my name is josh.. whats yours?

i'm a developer living out of the beautiful state of california. i focus a lot of my work on things like minecraft servers, fivem servers, and most things involving a community. but thats not all i do. i hang out with a lot of friends outside of my online life. i like to occasionally take the trip to topgolf, eat ice cream, and touch grass.
